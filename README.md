# gridpaper
Simple but powerful browser based grid generator.

The web page will simply have a text box, and a canvas. In order to add grid
lines, you'll be able to write in the text box using a simple notation with
commas, spaces, and linebreaks that will indicate the parameters for the grid.
The grid will be rendered each time the contents of the text box change,
set on an interval of 5 seconds or so.

The first line is for the canvas size. All proceeding lines contain one grid
descriptor per line.
